Rules of 21: 

- You start with a normal 52 card deck of the following values: 
  - 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
  - jack, queen, king, ace
- Goal is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over
  - If you go over 21, it's a 'bust'
- the game consists of a "dealer" and a "player"
  - both are dealt two cards
  - player CAN see their 2 cards, but can only see one of the dealer's cards
- Card values
  - all card values are straightfoward except for suits
  - jack, queen and king are worth 10
  - ace is worth 11 OR 1 and is determined each time a new card is drawn
    - if total value with newly drawn ace exceeds 21 (as 11), then value is 1
    - else value is 11
- Player turn
  - can either 'hit' or 'stay'
  - hit means the player will ask for another card
    - if total exceeds 21, player will 'bust' and lose
    - decision to hit or stay depends on what the player's cards are and what dealer has
  - turn is over when player either 'busts' or 'stays'
- Dealer turn
  - once player stays, it's the dealer's turn
  - dealer must follow a strict rule for determining whether to hit or stay
  - hit until the total is at least 17
  - if dealer busts, then the player wins
- Comparing cards
  - when both the player and the dealer stay, it's time to compare total value of cards to see who has the highest value

  1. start game
  2. shuffle deck
  3. Give 2 cards to player and dealer each
  4. evaluate total, 21?
  5. Player decides to hit or stay
    - if hit, player pulls card from deck
    - Evaluate total
    - Repeat 5 if necessary
  6. Dealer decides to hit or stay based on whether it has reached at least 17
    - if hit, dealer pulls card from deck
    - evaluate total
    - Repeat 6 if necessary
  7. Compare both decks
    - if total is the same, call 'push'
    - else whoever closer to 21 is the winner
  8. end game

P - PROBLEM
  - input: decision to hit or stay
    - remove card from main deck
    - add same card to player's deck
  - output: player 'busts', 'blackjacks', 'wins', or 'loses' (dealer won)

E - EXAMPLE
  - Player has 21, Dealer has 20
    -  Player 'Blackjack' and player won because dealer is less than 21
  - Player has 21, Dealer has 21
    - Both Blackjack, but 'push' since totals are equal
  - Player has 20, Dealer has 20
    - Both 'push' since totals are equal
  - Player has 20, Dealer has 19
    - Player wins, since total is closets to 21
  - Player has 10, 2, draws an Ace. Is the Ace 11 or 1?
    - Ace is 1 since (10 + 2 + 11) is greater than 21
    - Total is now (10 + 2 + 1) == 13

D - DATA STRUCTURE
  - initialize raw, main deck outside of loop
    - start game == loop
      - reset main deck (52 cards)
      - shuffle deck
      - remove 4 cards from main array
        - place 2 cards each to each player's array
        - evaluate totals
      - player will hit or stay
        - if hit, remove a card from main deck and store in player deck
        - evaluate total
        - declare winner if necessary
        - repeat if necessary
      - dealer will hit or stay based on total of 17 or more
        - if hit, remove a card from main deck and store in dealer deck
        - evaluate total
        - declare winner if necessary
        - repeat if necessary
      - compare totals
        - at this point, it's assumed that both totals are less than 21
        - declare winner
      - if playing again, start from loop
    - end game == end loop

D - DATA STRUCTURE CONTINUED
  - initialize CONSTANT hash outside of loop
    - this contains 52 cards with key value pairs
  - within game loop, set variable equal to cloned hash keys, that's shuffled
    - card selection
    - pull from keys (shift)
    - return value (card/key), it'referenced value from main deck hash is pushed to player array
    - because it's shifted, that key is now removed from the cloned keys list

A - ALGORITHM


C - CODE
  - initialize hash of 52 cards with key/value pairs


  1. give 2 cards to each player
  2. evaluate initial deal
    - if both players hit 21, decalre push
    - if one player hit 21, that player won
    - else continue
  3. player hits or stays
  4. evaluate first player total
    - if player > 21, delcare loss
    - else continue
  5. dealer hits or stays based on 17
    - if dealer total < 17, next
    - elsif dealer > 21, declare loss
    - else continue
  6. compare totals
    - at this point neither of them are past 21
    - if total is the same, then push
    - else whoever is closer to 21 is

1. dealer first compares existing total with new total of player
2. if dealer total > player total, dealer wins
3. else, if player total > 21
4. dealer wins
5. else if dealer total is greater than or equal to 17, dealer will stay
  - then compare totals
6. else if dealer total is less than 17, dealer will pull
7. go back to 5


1. if next card is == 11
AND existing total + 11 > 21
playerarray[] = 1
